# -Regression-Forecasting-and-Time-Series-Analysis

📌 Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict ride fare amounts based on historical Uber trip data. Conducted as part of a Data Science Internship at Tekniko Global from May 2024 to July 2024, the project applies various regression techniques to improve prediction accuracy for fare pricing in the ride-hailing sector.

📊 Objective
To forecast the fare_amount using features like pickup/dropoff coordinates, passenger count, and trip distance, leveraging supervised machine learning regression algorithms.
